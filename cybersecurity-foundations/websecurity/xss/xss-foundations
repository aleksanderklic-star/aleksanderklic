##  XSS, What Is It  (In progress)

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is an injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in another user's browser.

It occurs when a web application fails to properly validate or escape user input before rendering it in the page. As a result, the browser interprets that content as executable code instead of plain text.

This can allow attackers to steal session cookies (if they are not protected with HttpOnly), capture credentials, modify the page content, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

## What the Problem Is

The vulnerability exists because the application trusts user input without properly validating or escaping it. 

JavaScript itself is not the problem. The issue arises when user-controlled data is rendered in the browser without proper filtering or output encoding, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads that manipulate the webpage.

## Injection Contexts

In an HTML context, if user input is inserted inside an HTML element without proper escaping, an attacker may close the existing tag and inject a new one containing malicious code.

For example, if the input is rendered inside an HTML element, the attacker could close the current tag and introduce a <script> tag.

In a JavaScript context, something similar can happen. If user input is placed inside a string without proper validation, an attacker can break out of the string and append additional JavaScript code that will be executed by the browser.

This demonstrates that the type of payload depends on the context in which the input is reflected (HTML, attribute, JavaScript, URL, etc.).
